Data-driven analysis of U.S. flight delays (2019–2023) using Python, Tableau, and strategic frameworks

# Reducing U.S. Flight Delays Through Data-Driven Analysis ✈️

This project analyzes over 7 million U.S. domestic flight records (2019–2023) 
to uncover delay trends, identify root causes, and propose strategic 
data-driven solutions for airlines.

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Dataset: U.S. DOT / Kaggle (2019–2023, 7M+ flights)
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau, Business Frameworks (SWOT, TOWS, Value Chain)
- Key Findings:
  - Evening flights & weekends have the worst delays
  - Carrier-related delays > Weather delays
  - Severe delays (>60 mins) tripled after COVID
- Recommendation: Implement AI-driven weather prediction & rerouting platform

## 🚀 Results
- JetBlue & Frontier had the highest delays; Alaska the best performance
- Major hubs like ATL, MIA, FLL are congestion hotspots
- AI-based rerouting is the most cost-effective strategy to reduce delays
